    "* Python is the language you type\n",
    "* For a computer to do something with your text file, you need an **interpreter**\n",
    "* Enter: CPython\n",
    "* CPython is the most commonly used Python interpreter. If you're not sure what interpreter you're using, it's probably CPython!\n",
    "* Running a CPython REPL: `python`\n",
    "* Running a script: `python my_script.py`\n",
    "* Pro-tip: `python -i my_script.py` to execute your script and dump you into a REPL!\n",

    "### Beyond CPython\n",
    "* There are lots of other interpreters to be aware of:\n",
    "* PyPy: Makes your Python fast (but numpy slow)\n",
    "* Cython: Compiles your Python to C (sort of)\n",
    "* IronPython: Fast multi-threaded Python with no GIL\n",
    "* Jython: Use Java libraries in your Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions + Anaconda\n",
    "CPython can be augmented with pre-compiled (FORTRAN, C, C++) extensions for neat tricks like NumPy. The only reliable way to install these extensions is with Anaconda (conda -- see section 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is the best way to get a working CPython set up with scientific libraries, etc. More on this later."

    "        * In Python, this means \"find the value pointed to by `a`, store how to get to that value in `b`\"<br>Now `a` and `b` point to the exact same value\n",
